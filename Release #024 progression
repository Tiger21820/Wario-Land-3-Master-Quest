For release #024, changes have been made to the map event triggers, so The Temple will correctly direct the player to the next required treasure! Optional ones are mostly ordered based on the 100% guide on Nintendo 3DS Central: https://www.nintendo3dscentral.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=1749

Update: Changes reverted due to treasures activating the wrong events, and levels opening too early, will need to look into it further...
