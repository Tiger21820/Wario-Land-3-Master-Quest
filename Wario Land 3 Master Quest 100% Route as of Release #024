This is accurate as of Release #024 and later!
Note that this guide is NOT directed towards speedrunners (You can come up with those yourself!), but those who want to 100% the hack, as treasure availability gets rather confusing at times (and The Temple/Hidden Figure sure doesn't help, either! How are you supposed to get to The East Crater if it's not even open yet?)!
