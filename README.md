Here's the story:

Wario thought it was a very lovely day outside, so he decided to fly his plane across a large forest, 
hoping to score some treasure during the outing when suddenly his plane catches fire 
and makes a crash landing (his plane was totaled) into the vast forest...
Wario wanders around thinking his day couldn't get any worse when he stumbles into a cave with a beautiful music box on a pedestal...
Wario decided to try to wind it up and listen to it's melody, 
but however much he tried to turn the key, it wouldn't move! Wario, thinking that the thing was busted, 
turned to leave when suddenly, he finds himself in an unfamiliar location... 
Suddenly, a voice by a hidden figure tells Wario that the world he is in was made by Tiger21820, 
and that the hidden figure was the sage Tiger appointed to protect his world... 
The hidden figure then explained to Wario that a wicked being invaded Tiger's world, sealing him (Tiger) away, 
and that 5 music boxes were needed to release the seal holding Tiger and free him... 
Wario was told that if he frees Tiger, then Tiger would be able to return Wario back to his own world... 
Wario didn't think much of this story, so he sort of shrugged at it, 
but the hidden figure then added that if Wario finds any treasure during this quest, he will be able keep all of it! 
This DEFINITELY got Wario interested in the whole quest, so after some thinking, 
Wario gleefully agrees to rescue Tiger in exchange for all the treasure he can find! 
Wario leaves the temple and begins the most CHALLENGING quest Wario will EVER face!

So what happens next? 
How does it end? 
A better question... 
HOW DID IT BEGIN!?

Well, if you pay attention to the very last part of the credits, and maybe use that as a key... 
(and it's CASE SENSITVE! ALL CAPITALS!!!) 

You may just learn the full story!
